Synchronous
-----------
Synchronous means, each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing
callback
--------
Pros of Callback in Javascript
            First Pro in Simplicity.
            Second Pro is Popularity.
                  callbacks taken from some of the most popular javascript libraries.

Cons of Callback
    First Con is Lack of Readability.
                Sometimes itâ€™s hard to understand 
    Second Con is Callback Hell.
                 When you have several callbacks that depend on each other, you can have a situation that is called Callback Hell. 
Promise
-------
Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events.
        Benefits of Promises
        --------------------
        Improves Code Readability
        Better handling of asynchronous operations
        Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
        Better Error Handling
        A Promise has four states
        Promises solve the problem of call back hell
        -------------------------
        fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
        rejected: Action related to the promise failed
        pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
        settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
        Cons of using Promises over callbacks:
        ---------------------------------------
            It kills the purpose of asynchronous non-blocking I/O.
            Only one object can be returned.
            We cannot return multiple arguments.
